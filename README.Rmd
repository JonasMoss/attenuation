An `R` package for computing confidence curves, confidence intervals and *p*-values for [correlation coefficients corrected for attenuation due to measurement error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction_for_attenuation). The package implements the methods described in [Moss, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01576).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("attenuation")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Installation

Run the following in `R` to install the current CRAN release of the package.

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("attenuation")
```

Or use `devtools` to install the development version.

```{r install_devtools, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/attenuation")
```

## Usage
Use `cc` to calculate a confidence curve and `plot` to plot it. 

```{r simpleuse, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("attenuation")
r = c(0.20, sqrt(0.45), sqrt(0.55))
N = c(100, 100, 100)
curve = cc(r, N)
plot(curve, level = 0.90)
```

Confidence sets can be calculated with `ci`. *NB*: These sets are not 
necessarily intervals. They can be either the disjoint union of two intervals or empty.

```{R, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
ci(r, N)
```

To find the *p*-value for the null hypothesis of a specific rho, use the 
`p_value` function.
```{R, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
p_value(rho = 0, r, N)
```
